# Prediction-of-Dengue-Spread
Applied various supervised learning algorithms to predict the number of dengue cases each week in San Juan, Puerto Rico and Iquitos, Peru.

# Objective
To predict the number of dengue fever cases reported each week in San Juan, Puerto Rico and Iquitos, Peru using environmental test data for a future date, from 2008 (week 18) till 2013 (week 13) for San Juan , and from 2010 (week 26) till 2013 (week 26) for Iquitos.

# Approach
We used several supervised machine learning algorithms including Decision (Regression) Tree, Random Forest, Extreme Gradient Boosting, Partial Least Squares, and GLMNET for building the prediction model on the training set and compared their performance. Finally, the champion model was chosen for predicting outcomes on the future test dataset.
